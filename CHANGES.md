# CHANGES: Di:ME JAVA REFERENCE

## Version 1.0.1 - 2022-xx-xx
- Adds an option to exclude the trust chain from an issued identity, allows for more flexible usage and trust verification
- Method Identity:isTrusted() and Identity:isTrusted(Identity) is added for more fine-grained verification of trust chains
- Method Identity:verifyTrust() is deprecated and will be removed in future versions
- Additional unit tests added (from C#/.NET reference implementation)
