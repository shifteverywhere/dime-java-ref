# Di:ME JAVA reference implementation

Di:ME (Data Integrity Message Envelope) is a powerful universal data format that is built for secure, and integrity protected communication between entities in a trusted network. It is built with modern thinking and ease-of-use throughout. Although it can be used together with X.509 certificates, it has its own built in public key-based entity identification through a trusted chain. This makes it equally suitable as an alternative to certificate-based PKIs.

Potential use cases for Di:ME includes:
•	IOT networks for distributing sensitive data, including collected sensor data, operation instructions, patches and firmware updates
•	Automatic processing where audit trails and results logging is curial
•	Peer-to-peer messaging where each responses gets cryptographically linked
•	Distribution of sensitive information and records within large networks
•	Establishing application-based networks with trusted entities

The strength of Di:ME is its modular format, where applications and networks can pick and mix to suit their own specific needs. At the same time, it removes the need to build complicated mechanisms for authenticating senders and validating payloads of data.

Note that this is still a work in progress and is thus subject to change.
